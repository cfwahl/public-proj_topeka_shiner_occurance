* = Minnesota and Iowa in the same file
# = Stream and oxbows in the same file
^ = Manually moved sites because 1) DEM streamline was off for six stream sites (siteid = 160-164, 167), 2) sites were exactly the same location with dummy site thus not producing a watershed (siteid = 19, 242). File with manually moved points is â€œdata_fmt/vector/epsg4326_mn_dnr_fws_fmt_sites_snap2.shp"
@ = used a stream network file that manually removed unnecessary streams outside of study network. This allows for faster computation when estimating distance among sites. File is "data_fmt/vector/epsg3722_minnesota_stream_dispersal_5km2.shp"
